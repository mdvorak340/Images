    <h1>I Draw.  Sometimes.  Mayhaps.</h1>

    <wiqi-content>
      <p>
        I occasionally remember I'm an artist and draw something.  If I'm happy
        with it or think I can justify how bad it is, I post it here!

        You'll notice this page isn't very long.

      <figcaption>
        When <cite>Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye</cite> first came out I
        wanted to use the promotional art as a wallpaper, but couldn't find any
        version of it not bit-crushed to hell and back, so <strong>I traced the
        art</strong> and used it for lighting practice.
        <br />
        Made with Adobe Illustrator in 2021.

      <figcaption>
        Drawing of Sova from <cite>Valorant</cite> I made when the beta came
        out.  Drew this on a Chromebook running Ubuntu and an <em>ancient</em>
        version of GIMP, <strong>it might be a trace</strong> (most of my art
        from back then was) but I cannot find any source image if it is.
        <br />
        Made with GIMP in 2020.
