      <p>
        <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the tool used to
        create this website and all others on the internet. Even more
        complicated tools like <abbr title="Personal Home Page">PHP</abbr> and
        Microsoft's Blazor become plain old HTML by the time they reach your
        browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML is rarely used alone, though — it is almost always paired with
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to do the styling and
        JavaScript to make the site reactive (e.g. buttons most animations).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many other additional tools you can use to make writing
        websites easier and so, <em>so</em> much harder at the same time, such
        as:

              <a rel="external" href="https://react.dev/">React</a> is a
              JavaScript library maintained by Meta née Facebook that provides
              tools that let you build websites using HTML 'components' defined
              in JavaScript.

              <a rel="external" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
              is a collection of predefined CSS classes that aim to make it
              easier to style mobile-first websites, and is especially known
              for 'flexboxes' that adapt to the screen size to best fit the
              page.

        There are tools that extend the functionality of websites using
        dedicated servers, like:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <details>
              <summary>PHP</summary>
            </details>
          </li>
          <li>
            <details>
              <summary>Blazor</summary>
            </details>
          </li>
          <li>
            <details>
              <summary>Node.js</summary>
            </details>
          </li>
        </ul>
        For this website, however, we chose to use only vanilla HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript in a misguided and quickly abandoned attempt to keep things
        simple.  Read on to learn how we did it!

      <summary>XHTML</summary>

      <wiqi-content>
        <p>
          You might have noticed a little discrepancy when reading through this
          site — we state that we only use plain old HTML, but if you check the
          file extensions, they say <em>X</em>HTML!  Is XHTML some weird HTML
          framework that changes the way you wrote the page?
        </p>
        <p>
          Not quite.  When the HTML you write gets read by a browser, it is
          parsed by some computer program to turn the code into graphics — but
          this program isn't very strict.  There is, however, an
          <em>alternate</em> parser based on
          <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, another project
          of W3C that is structured similarly to HTML.  This XML parser is
          very exact about what it expects, and if the file isn't 'well-formed'
          it gives an error.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use XHTML (or "the XML syntax for HTML" as it is now called)
          you are informing the browser to read your HTML code like it is an
          XML document.  This means if the parser finds an error in your code,
          it <em>won't</em> render the page at all, while the standard HTML
          will just take a guess at what you <em>probably</em> meant and render
          the page anyway — without giving you any indication that it found an
          error.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a few other changes that XHTML makes, but almost all of it
          is commonly taught as good practice for HTML anyway.  Good HTML is
          already 90% of the way to XHTML, and most XHTML is also valid HTML —
          if you code it right, all of it is! (referred to as 'polygot').  This
          wiki was originally just HTML, but only had to have one line changed
          to make it valid XHTML, for instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list of rules XHTML imposes on HTML — most of which you already
          follow! — are as below:
          <ul>
            <li>
              You most always close your tags — in HTML, if you forget a
              <code lang="html">&lt;p&gt;</code>'s closing
              <code lang="html">&lt;/p&gt;</code> the parser will insert its
              own closing tag where it thinks one belongs, or just apply
              <code lang="html">p</code> styles to everything after.
            </li>
            <li>
              All tags must be lower-case only.
            </li>
            <li>
              All attribute values must be quoted — no
              <code lang="html"
                  >&lt;a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat&gt;</code>.
              Also, no empty boolean attributes:
              Use <code lang="html">&lt;details open="true"&gt;</code>, not
              <code lang="html">&lt;details open&gt;</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              All tags must be closed, even "self-closing" ones like
              <code lang="html">img</code> or <code lang="html">link</code>.
              This is done by using a <kbd>/</kbd> at the end of the tag, e.g.
              <code lang="html">&lt;img src="" alt="" title="" /&gt;</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              All images must have alt text (the <code lang="html">alt</code>
              attribute).
            </li>
            <li>
              All pages need a title.
            </li>
            <li>
              The only character entities (<code>&amp;foo;</code> symbols) that
              are defined are <code>amp</code> (<kbd>&amp;</kbd>),
              <code>lt</code> (<kbd>&lt;</kbd>), <code>gt</code>
              (<kbd>&gt;</kbd>), <code>apos</code> (<kbd>&apos;</kbd>), and
              <code>quot</code> (<kbd>&quot;</kbd>). Everything else should be
              the actual UTF-8 character, not a stand-in.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The advantages of XHTML are that it:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Loads faster (doesn't have to do all the error-handling overhead
              HTML does).
            </li>
            <li>
              Saves you from making and missing simple errors that mess with
              site content, and in general forces you to write better code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Is compatible with anything that uses XML — for instance, the
              <code lang="js">XMLHttpRequest</code> JavaScript object used to
              query the very page you're reading!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to make your page use the XHTML5 parser (available wherever
          HTML5 is, which at the moment is <em>the entire web</em>) you need
          to change the file extension to <code>.xhtml</code> and alter a bit
          of the page preamble:
        </p>
        <code lang="html">
<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xml:lang="en"
      lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type"
          content="application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8" /&gt;

    &lt;title&gt;Page With An XHTML Header&lt;/title&gt;
    ...</pre>
        </code>
        <p>
          This links to the authority on what is and isn't valid XHTML (the
          link) and tells the browser to read the page as an XHTML/XML
          application, along with specifying a character set while we're at
          it.
