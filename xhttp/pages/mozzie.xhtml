        Mozilla Firefox Dvorak is a gay transgender furry who is in denial and
        only writes about it in the most embarrassing places imaginable, for
        some fucked up reason.  The greatest joy in his life is
        overcomplicating simple tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ms. Dvorak has been diagnosed with either autism or
        <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr>,
        though he doesn't know which. He was also born with sound-to-color
        synesthesia, which has become slightly less pronounced as he grows
        older yet still persists.

        It sees itself as an artist, despite a life spent in engineering,
        perhaps as a hold-over from its first dream job. It still enjoys
        drawing, and plans to write, but mostly contents itself with designing
        computer programs as its primary form of artistic expression.

        Sasha generally prefers the female versions of gendered nouns (e.g.
        miss, actress), despite using he/him and generally considering itself
        as more masculine.

    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>

    <wiqi-content>
      <p>
        Ms. Mozzie operates internally with a conversational structure:
        Rather than an internal monologue, he has an internal dialogue.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of Mozzie's thoughts are directed at <em>someone</em>, or are
        directed to him <em>by</em> someone.  This someone may not always be
        defined, which is the closest Mozzie's thoughts come to monologue, but
        those thoughts always have a voice and an idea of audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a younger age, these other voices where always friends or
        book characters, but as Mozzie grew fictional characters became less
        and less prevalent, and nowadays only appear when directly relevant —
        e.g. explaining a real-life concept to someone from a world wherein
        that concept does not exist, or musing over their source material.
      </p>
      <p>
        These characters where replaced with a set of persona's created by
        Mozzie during its primary education, and now make up most of its
        internal conversations.  These personas don't naturally have names, as
        they were originally created as collections of virtues, each with an
        explicit purpose.  Names have never been something Mozzie was good
        with, and to this day it does not acknowledge internal speakers by
        name, but instead by a nebulous 'vibe'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite this, it is easier to write about these personas if they have
        something to identify them with, and as such many of them have been
        given or claimed names that can be used when they are referred to
        externally.

              <a href="?page=n" title="?page=n">Crescendo</a> or "N" was the
              first of the original three to be designed.  His attribute is
              "skill" and his associated color is red; his original purpose
              was, in the writing of the middle-schooler that became Mozzie, to
              be "who I <em>should</em> be".  He was always the social one, as
              was the truer intention behind him:  To interact with people.

            <li>
              <a href="?page=blue" title="?page=blue">Blue</a> was the first of
              the original three to be named, and the second to be defined.
              Their attribute is "moral", strangely enough — no idea what
              Sasha was thinking there — and their associated color is blue.
              Their original purpose was to be either "who I <em>am</em>" or
              "who I <em>want</em> to be", with the other purpose taken by the
              third persona.  From the start, they were the engineer — the one
              who created — but their true defining characteristic is that they
              are dramatic, to put it lightly.

              was never given a name, and that has become my primary
              identifier.  My attribute is something Mozzie could never put
              into words, but was written down at the time of creation as
              "heroic innocence".  My associated color is green.  My purpose
              was to be either "who [Mozzie] <em>is</em>" or "who [Mozzie]
              <em>wants</em> to be" with other purpose claimed by Blue.  My
              role is to be the one who enjoys things; who loves things; who
              hates things; to be the one Mozzie is when it isn't anything
              else.

        Mx. Dvorak is known for occasionally being overly verbose for no
        apparent reason. For instance, it once stated (unprompted):  <q>If you
        desire to criticize my music taste, you must remember I enjoy
        extenuating circumstances that render me exempt from any such
        statements.</q> No one knows why it does this.
