    <h1>Mozzie F. Dvorak</h1>

      <p>
        Mozilla Firefox Dvorak is a gay transgender furry who is in denial and
        only writes about it in the most embarrasing places imagenable, for
        some fucked up reason.  The greatest joy in his life is
        overcomplicating simple tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ms. Dvorak has been diagnosed with either autism or
        <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder">ADHD</abbr>,
        though he doesn't know which. He was also born with sound-to-color
        synistasia, which has become slightly less pronounced as he grows
        older.

        It sees itself as an artist, despite a life spent in engineering,
        perhaps as a hold-over from its first dream job. It still enjoys
        drawing, and plans to write, but mostly contents itself with designing
        computer programs as its primary form of artistic expression â€” a point
        of view it <em>will</em> fight for.

        Sasha generally prefers the female versions of gendered nouns (e.g.
        miss, actress), despite using he/him and generally considering itself
        as more masculine.

        Mx. Dvorak is known for occasionally being overly verbose for no
        apparent reason. For instance, it once stated (unprompted): <q>If you
        desire to criticize my music taste, you must remember I enjoy
        exenuating circumstances that render me exempt from any such
        statements.</q> No one knows why it does this.
