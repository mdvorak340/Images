          Mozilla Firefox Dvorak is a gay transgender furry who is in denial and
          only writes about it in the most embarrasing places imagenable, for some
          fucked up reason.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ms. Dvorak has been diagnosed with either autism or
          <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder">ADHD</abbr>, though
          he doesn't know which. He was also born with sound-to-color synistasia,
          which has become slightly less pronounced as he grows older.

        <p>
          It sees itself as an artist, despite a life spent in engineering,
          perhaps as a hold-over from its first dream job. It still enjoys
          drawing, and plans to write, but mostly contents itself with designing
          computer programs as its primary form of artistic expression &mdash; a
          point of view it <i>will</i> fight for.

          Mx. Dvorak is known for occasionally being overly verbose for no
          apparent reason. For instance, it once stated (unprompted): <q>If you
          desire to criticize my music taste, you must remember I enjoy
          exenuating circumstances that render me exempt from any such
          statements.</q> No one knows why it does this.
        </p>

        <p>Other cult hits include:</p>

          <q speaker="2">It was my grandfather's.</q>

        <p>
          <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the tool
          used to create this website and all others on the internet. Even more
          complicated tools like <abbr title="Personal Home Page">PHP</abbr> and
          Microsoft's Blazor become plain old HTML by the time they reach your
          browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML is rarely used alone, though &mdash; it is almost always paired
          with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to do the
          styling and JavaScript to make the site reactive (e.g. buttons most
          animations).
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many other additional tools you can use to make writing
          websites easier and so, <i>so</i> much harder at the same time, such
          as:
          <ul>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>Bootstrap</li>
            <li>JSX</li>
            <li>JQuery</li>
          </ul>
          There are tools that extend the functionality of websites using
          dedicated servers, like:
          <ul>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>Blazor</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
          </ul>
          For this website, however, we chose to use only vanilla HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript in a misguided and quickly abandonded attempt to
          keep things simple.  Read on to learn how we did it!
