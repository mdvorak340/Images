    <p>
      Mozilla Firefox Dvorak is a gay transgender furry who is in denial and
      only writes about it in the most embarrasing places imagenable, for some
      fucked up reason.

    <p>
      Ms. Dvorak has been diagnosed with either autism or
      <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder">ADHD</abbr>, though
      he doesn't know which. He was also born with sound-to-color synistasia,
      which has become slightly less pronounced as he grows older.

      It sees itself as an artist, despite a life spent in engineering,
      perhaps as a hold-over from its first dream job. It still enjoys
      drawing, and plans to write, but mostly contents itself with designing
      computer programs as its primary form of artistic expression -- a
      point of view it <i>will</i> fight for.
