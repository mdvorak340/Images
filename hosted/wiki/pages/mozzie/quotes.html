      Mx. Dvorak is known for occasionally being overly verbose for no
      apparent reason. For instance, it once stated (unprompted): <q>If you
      desire to criticize my music taste, you must remember I enjoy
      exenuating circumstances that render me exempt from any such
      statements.</q> No one knows why it does this.
    </p>
