    <p>
      <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the tool
      used to create this website and all others on the internet. Even more
      complicated tools like <abbr title="Personal Home Page">PHP</abbr> and
      Microsoft's Blazor become plain old HTML by the time they reach your
      browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML is rarely used alone, though -- it is almost always paired
      with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to do the
      styling and JavaScript to make the site reactive (e.g. buttons most
      animations).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many other additional tools you can use to make writing
      websites easier and so, <i>so</i> much harder at the same time, such
      as:
      <ul>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Bootstrap</li>
        <li>JSX</li>
        <li>JQuery</li>
      </ul>
      There are tools that extend the functionality of websites using
      dedicated servers, like:
      <ul>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>Blazor</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
      </ul>
      For this website, however, we chose to use only vanilla HTML, CSS,
      and JavaScript in a misguided and quickly abandonded attempt to
      keep things simple.  Read on to learn how we did it!
