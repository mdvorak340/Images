    <p>Mozilla Firefox Dvorak is a gay transgender furry who is in denial
    and only writes about it in the most embarrasing places imagenable,
    for some fucked up reason.</p>
    <p>Ms. Dvorak has been diagnosed with either autism or
    <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder">ADHD</abbr>, though
    he doesn't know which.  He was also born with sound-to-color
    synistasia, which has become slightly less pronounced as he grows older.</p>
    <p>It sees itself as an artist, despite a life spent in engineering,
    perhaps as a hold-over from its first dream job.  It still
    enjoys drawing, and plans to write, but mostly contents itself with
    designing computer programs as its primary form of artistic
    expression &mdash; a point of view it <i>will</i> fight for.</p>

    <h2>Quotes</h2>
    <p>Mx. Dvorak is known for occasionally being overly verbose for no apparent reason.
    For instance, it once stated (unprompted):  <q>If you desire to criticize my music taste, you must
    remember I enjoy exenuating circumstances that render me exempt from any such
    statements.</q>  No one knows why it does this.</p>
    <p>Other cult hits include:</p>
    <quote-environment>
      <q>Where'd you get that jacket?</q>
      <q speaker="md">It was my grandfather's.</q>
      <q speaker="md">I wonder how he feels, looking down from heaven
      and seeing his clothes get worn by some gay idiot who roleplays
      Nepeta Leijon.</q>
